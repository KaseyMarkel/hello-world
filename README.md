# hello-world
I've waited too long to start sharing my code - now is the time!

I've been using code in some form or another since sophomore year of high school when I wrote games and equation solvers on my TI84. 
However, it's never been my full-time gig, and I've only received a little formal training.
Current bests language is R, mostsly for data visualization.
